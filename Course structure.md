# Techtonic Academy

## Overview

When apprentices arrive at Tecthonic, they often have very little or no professional experience in the software industry, and we cannot assume any level of knowledge beyond the pre-work they have completed. Before they are sent to the floor to apprentice on commercial projects, they first must complete an intensive, full-time, 15-week, instructor-led classroom portion. 

The course is divided into 3 units, followed by a final project:

1. Programming Fundamentals (4 weeks)

- Intro to Development (concepts, technologies, and processes)
- JavaScript (review of data types, variables, loops, and functions)
- Java (intro to object-oriented programming, APIE, interfaces, and design patterns)
- Software Quality (unit testing, test-driven development, debugging)

2. Full-Stack Web Application (4 weeks)

- UI Design (HTML, accessibility, responsiveness, BEM, and SCSS)
- UI Engineering (DOM elements and events, TypeScript, Vue, and HTTP requests)
- Web Services (NodeJS with Express or Fastify, routing, middleware)
- Relational Databases (database design, writing SQL queries, and ORMs)

3. Advanced Topics (4 weeks)

- Enterprise Java
- Spring Boot
- Docker
- Deployment
- Security

4. Capstone Project (3 weeks)
